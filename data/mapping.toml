# --- SECTION: Core Transliteration Mappings ---
# These sections define the fundamental character-to-character mapping rules
# that the transliteration engine uses. The engine will look up Roman sequences
# in these maps to convert them to Devanagari.

[charMap]
# This section maps Roman vowels, symbols, and numbers to their Devanagari equivalents.

# Vowels and Diphthongs:
# Maps common Roman vowel sequences to their corresponding Devanagari vowels.

# Symbols:
# Symbols are enclosed in single quotes to avoid parsing conflicts in some file formats (e.g., TOML).
# These map specific Roman symbols to Devanagari diacritics and punctuation.
'*' = "ं"   # Anusvara
'**' = "ँ"  # Candrabindu
'.' = "।"   # Purnabiram
'\\' = "्"  # Halant (Virama)
'/' = '/'   # Placeholder for special rule logic (e.g., in 'ta/raaii')
'|' = "।"   # Alternative Purnabiram
'^' = "र्‍" # Repha (re-ph)

# Special Words:
# Direct mapping for specific Roman words to their Devanagari forms.
"om" = "ॐ"
"aum" = "ॐ"

# Numbers:
# Maps Roman digits (0-9) to their Devanagari counterparts (०-९).

[consonantMap]
# This section maps Roman consonant sequences (typically a consonant followed by 'a') to
# their base Devanagari consonant form. These are the building blocks of syllables.

# Basic Consonants:
# Maps a single Roman consonant + 'a' to a full Devanagari consonant sound.
