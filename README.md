Uses the `liblekhika` package for the core Lekhika library. See the build instructions below.

Download the database and place it in `~/.local/share/lekhika-core/` manually if you want to use the pre-trained file. Alternatively, use `lekhika-cli` from the command line. `lekhika-cli` is included with the `liblekhika` package.

Optionally, you can install `lekhika-trainer`, a Qt6 GUI application for easy dictionary manipulation and testing.

# fcitx5-lekhika

**fcitx5-lekhika** is a transliteration-based input method for [Fcitx5](https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx5) focused on improving Nepali typing workflows. The project uses the core transliteration engine from [liblekhika](https://github.com/khumnath/liblekhika), which is a separate package and must be installed first as a dependency.

# Fcitx5 Lekhika Module

`fcitx5-lekhika`: A phonetic and rule-based input method engine that provides system-wide integration for seamless Nepali typing.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Powered by the `liblekhika` core engine:**
    * Unicode-compliant Nepali transliteration.
    * Modular architecture with TOML-based mapping for easy customization.
    * Autocorrection for common typos via customizable dictionaries.
    * Clean integration with the Fcitx5 input method framework.

* **Key Functions:**
    * **Space** ‚Üí Commits the transliterated word. If suggestion commit is enabled, it commits the first suggestion. If you have navigated the suggestions with an arrow key, it commits the highlighted suggestion.
    * **Enter** ‚Üí Commits the transliterated word if there are no suggestions. If suggestions are present, it commits the highlighted one.
    * **Numbers 1-9** ‚Üí Commits the corresponding numbered suggestion. Otherwise, it inputs the digit. If number transliteration is enabled, it inputs the Nepali numeral.
    * **Esc** ‚Üí Commits the raw English text as typed.
    * **Symbols** ‚Üí If symbol transliteration is enabled, keys like `*` are converted to their Nepali counterparts. The full stop and question mark always commit the current text and are not used for suggestions.
    * **Arrow Up/Down** ‚Üí Navigates through the suggestion list.
    * **Arrow Left/Right** ‚Üí Changes the cursor position in the input buffer.

## üìñ Dependencies

To build this project from source, you will need the following development packages.

### ‚úÖ Debian / Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake ninja-build \
libfcitx5core-dev libfcitx5config-dev libfcitx5utils-dev \
libsqlite3-dev libicu-dev

```

### ‚úÖ Fedora

Shell

```
sudo dnf install rpm-build cmake ninja-build gcc-c++ \
fcitx5-devel qt6-qtbase-devel sqlite-devel libicu-devel

```

### ‚úÖ Arch Linux / Manjaro

Shell

```
sudo pacman -Syu --needed base-devel cmake ninja \
fcitx5-qt qt6-base sqlite icu

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

First, build and install `liblekhika`:

Shell

```
git clone [https://github.com/khumnath/liblekhika.git](https://github.com/khumnath/liblekhika.git)
cd liblekhika
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
cd ..
```

Next, build and install `fcitx5-lekhika`:

Shell

```
git clone [https://github.com/khumnath/fcitx5-lekhika.git](https://github.com/khumnath/fcitx5-lekhika.git)
cd fcitx5-lekhika
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build

```

To uninstall the project later, you can run `sudo make uninstall` from within the `build` directory.

### Prebuilt Packages

Prebuilt packages will be available in the near future.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage & Activation

### 1. Activating the Input Method

After installation, you need to enable the input method:

1.  Run `fcitx5-configtool` (or right-click the Fcitx5 icon in your system tray and choose "Configure").
    
2.  Go to the **Input Method** tab.
    
3.  Click the **+** button in the bottom-left corner.
    
4.  Uncheck "Only Show Current Language".
    
5.  Search for **"Lekhika"** and add it to the list of active input methods.
    
6.  You can now switch to it using your configured hotkey (e.g., `Ctrl+Space`).

### 2. Using the Dictionary Trainer

The `lekhika-cli` tool (installed with `liblekhika`) allows you to manage the dictionary used by the input method.

Check the `lekhika-cli` command-line options for more details, or use the [lekhika-trainer](https://github.com/khumnath/lekhika-trainer) GUI for easy dictionary management and testing.

## üîß Configuration

To customize the transliteration rules, you can manually edit the TOML files located in:

/usr/share/lekhika-core/
